# Kidney Stone Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Kidney Stone Prediction project! This project is designed to predict the likelihood of kidney stones using various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), ExtraTrees Classifier, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. This project aims to leverage machine learning to assist in the early detection and prevention of kidney stones.

## Introduction

Kidney stones are a common urological problem affecting millions of people worldwide. Early prediction can significantly help in preventing severe complications. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of kidney stones based on various medical and demographic features.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features such as age, gender, dietary habits, medical history, and more. The dataset can be sourced from medical records or publicly available health datasets.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:
1. Loading the dataset.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Encoding categorical variables.
4. Scaling the features.

## Model Training

We will train multiple machine learning models for the prediction task:
1. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: Effective for high-dimensional spaces.
2. **ExtraTrees Classifier**: An ensemble method that builds multiple trees.
3. **Decision Tree**: A simple yet powerful algorithm for classification.
4. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

Steps for training the models:
1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Initialize each model.
3. Train each model on the training data.

## Model Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the models, we will use metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

We will also plot the confusion matrix for a detailed evaluation.

## Usage

To use the trained models for making predictions on new data, follow these steps:

1. Load the pre-trained model from the saved file.
2. Prepare the input data in the same format as the training data.
3. Use the model to make predictions.

Example code:

```python
import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained model
with open('kidney_stone_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

# Sample input data (replace with actual data)
input_data = np.array([[...]])

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(input_data)
print(predictions)
```
